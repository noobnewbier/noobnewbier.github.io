        During my time with <a href="https://www.aurochdigital.com/">Sumo Group - Auroch Digital</a>, I am the tool programmer for the sequel of the hugely successful <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/765810/Mars_Horizon/">Mars Horizon</a> - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2281620/Mars_Horizon_2_The_Search_for_Life/">Mars Horizon 2</a>. 
        Whilst Mars Horizon 2 is still work in progress, the tools I created contributed heavily into the creation of our prototypes, and facilitated the release of the official trailer.
           
        The announcement was a success, as we can observe in the Mars Horizon Discord, with many supported of the prequel expressing their anticipation.

        In the process, I contributed by creating various complex yet easy to use tools for designers, artists and programemr. Some of the more significant work includes a Data Editor which allows designer to edit data structure that is traditionally impossible in Unity,
        and creating code generation tool for our UI programming crews.

        implementing physics-related gameplay features, and developing most of the UIs for both the prototype and the final product. I am glad that the game was generally well received.
