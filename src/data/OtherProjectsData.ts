            The sheer amount of clients we were dealing with simultaneously and the new contracts the company is making introduced various challenges

                <strong>Cast</strong> is a two-part software, with the highly customizable display control implemented using WPF and the rendering handled in Unity.
                <br/>

                Due to the software nature, the solution we provide must be both reliable and highly customizable. The elegant solution we created sparked my interest in tools development.
                I am hence tainted with developing in WPF and am capable of using Unity outside of game development.
